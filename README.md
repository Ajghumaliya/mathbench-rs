# mathbench

[![Build Status]][travis-ci]

A number of benchmarks that compare the performance of different Rust math
libraries for common game development and graphics tasks.

`mathbench` is written by the author of [`glam`][glam] and has been used to
compare the performance of `glam` with other similar 3D math libraries targeting
games and graphics development, including:

* [`cgmath`][cgmath]
* [`nalgebra-glm`][nalgebra-glm]

## The benchmarks

All benchmarks are performed using [Criterion.rs].

* `euler bench` - performs an Euler integration on arrays of 2D and 3D vectors
* `mat4 bench` - performs common matrix operations such as transpose, inverse
  and determinant
* `transform bench` - performs matrix transformations on 4D vectors

## Future work

* Add more benchmarks
* Validate the correctness of each benchmark
* Produce graphs comparing the different libraries at each task
* Add `packed_simd` to benchmarks
* Add `ISPC` to benchmarks
